(Ugly) AutohotKey script to decompile the (non-standard) LUA files
Needs a copy of unluac_2015_06_13.jar in same folder as DecompileLUA.ahk (or change the path in the ini)
Edit DecompileLUA.ini before starting it
```

[AutohotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/)

[Java](https://java.com/download)

[unluac](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unluac/files/Unstable/)

Use [hpk](https://github.com/nickelc/hpk) to extract LUA files from hpk archives  (don't use the --fix-lua-files flag when you extract, as DecompileLUA does that)

### Thank you [nickelc](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/tropico-3-4-5-hpk-archiver.113705/page-6#post-3815805) for showing how to change the header
