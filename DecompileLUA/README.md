(Ugly) AutohotKey script to decompile the (non-standard) LUA files
Needs a copy of unluac_2015_06_13.jar in same folder as DecompileLUA.ahk (or change the path in the ini)
Edit DecompileLUA.ini before starting it
```

[AutohotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/)

[Java](https://java.com/download)

[unluac](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unluac/files/Unstable/)

Use [hpk](https://github.com/nickelc/hpk) to extract LUA files from hpk archives  (make sure to use the --fix-lua-files flag when you extract)
