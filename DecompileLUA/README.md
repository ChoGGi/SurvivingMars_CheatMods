(Ugly) AutohotKey script to decompile the (non-standard) LUA files
Needs a copy of unluac_2015_06_13.jar in same folder as DecompileLUA.ahk (or change the path in the ini)
Edit DecompileLUA.ini before starting it

The java decompiler? randomly barfs on lua files, so it's best to decompile a couple copies and compare.

[unluac](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unluac/files/Unstable/)

Use [hpk](https://github.com/nickelc/hpk) to extract LUA files from hpk archives  (make sure to use the --fix-lua-files flag when you extract)
