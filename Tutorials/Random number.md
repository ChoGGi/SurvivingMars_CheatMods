### Return a random number

AsyncRand() has slightly more variation then Random(), and possibly more than UICity:Random() (never bothered to test).
It's also faster (though the ifs I added may make this function slower).

Random() -- returns number between 0 and max_int
Random(10) -- returns number between 0 - 10
Random(-50,10) -- returns number between -50 - 10

```lua
do
	local AsyncRand = AsyncRand
	function Random(m, n)

		-- m = min, n = max
		if n then

			-- return nil instead of just returning max without any randomness
			if n-m < 0 then
				return
			end

			return AsyncRand(n - m + 1) + m

		else
			-- m = max, min = 0 OR number between 0 and max_int
			return m and AsyncRand(m) or AsyncRand()
		end

	end
end
```

#### If you're sure you won't send n-m < 0 then you can skip that
```lua
do
	local AsyncRand = AsyncRand
	function Random(m, n)
		if n then
			-- m = min, n = max
			return AsyncRand(n - m + 1) + m
		else
			-- m = max, min = 0 OR number between 0 and max_int
			return m and AsyncRand(m) or AsyncRand()
		end
	end
end
```
