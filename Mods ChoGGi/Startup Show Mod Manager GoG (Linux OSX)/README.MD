### This needs to be placed in the game folder for Surviving Mars
### NOT in AppData\Surviving Mars (see Install Help.png)

```
Surviving Mars\BinAssets\AssetsRevision.lua

This is for GoG Linux/OSX users, since SM devs didn't add the best condition check...

Platform.steam or Platform.pc

instead of:
not Platform.console
or:
Platform.desktop
```

##### OSX Install Help (thanks BodyByBuddha)
```
- Expand the zip & you'll see a BinAssets folder & this readme file.
- Move the BinAssets folder to /Applications/Surviving Mars.app/Contents/Resources
- Start the game and you should see the Mod Manager.

If you are using Finder, to open the Surviving Mars.app, right click on the application icon and select Show Package Contents.


Or even easier: Open a new Finder window.
Hit Command-Shift-G.
Paste "/Applications/Surviving Mars.app/Contents/Resources" (without quotes) into the resulting dialog.
Hit Return. Drag BinAssets from Downloads to the resulting folder.
```
