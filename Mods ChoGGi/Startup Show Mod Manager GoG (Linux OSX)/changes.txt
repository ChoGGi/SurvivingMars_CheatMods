v0.9
AssetsRevision.lua updated (wasn't working on mod manager refresh).

v0.8
Gagarin.
Changed it from changing the xtemplate to just directly changing the UI.
It should be more update friendly now.

v0.7
Da Vinci.
More durable checking.
Intergrated with my HelperMod for ECM (easier to have the two both installed).

v0.6
Switched from checking Platform (.steam or .pc or .linux or .osx) to (.desktop).

v0.5
This broke in the Curo update.

v0.4
The tutorial button messed it up (won't happen again for new buttons).

v0.3
Now retrieves the correct Assets Revision, so no more need for version bumping.

v0.2
version bump for curo update.
