I'd be really thankful for that because I cannot play the game without Bleech setting. It's complete game changer to play with your mod the game looks the way it suppose to look I think. But it would be great if we could adjust brightness exposure and fog density like in photo mod for even better results. Mmmmm please please :)
 And is it possible to make adjustment sliders accessible as well?
