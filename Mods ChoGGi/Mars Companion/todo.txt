set hover ehight, plant green and trees like monkohime
less x/y area
use parabol func to make smooth turns

maybe check out nearby buildings and rocks, some beeping noises or such?
snuggles up to the camera and beeps at you?
checks out the cursor if you've left it hovering over a building

throws rocks around if camera stays in same place for awhile
randomly picks up drones and "plays"? with them


maybe add a selection panel saying if it's bored or not?

or give it a storage area, and let it become a little hoarder, the possibilites are so much fun
turning these cute little companions into little three yo, would cause plenty of relatively harmless mayhem. I would add a feature that turns switches on your power cables and pipes on or off at random.. or turning down Triboelectric scrubbers, those kind of things. or even just whizzing around a building to make it extra dusty randomly would be fun as well.

turn off for a few seconds then back on
