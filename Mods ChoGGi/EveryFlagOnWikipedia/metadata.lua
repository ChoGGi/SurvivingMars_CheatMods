  "description", [[Adds every flag on Wikipedia (450+), and no more Martian only names.

Since this game uses nations for names, this also takes all the in-game names and applies them to all the nations (see below to disable).

This also sets const.FullTransitionToMarsNames to 9999 (Sols), and adds all the names to Mars (I think we've all seen enough of Cosmo Cosmos).

Mod Config Reborn:
If you want martians to have martian names: Randomise Birthplace
If you don't want existing nations to use random names: Default Nation Names

I also added a few unique names associated with space.
Suggestions welcome, for names already added see: https://github.com/ChoGGi/SurvivingMars_CheatMods/blob/master/Mods%20ChoGGi/EveryFlagOnWikipedia/Code/Script.lua#L64
^ New game needed to see uniques.

If you have a list of names you'd like to add:
Male given
Female given
Family (separate male/female family names are doable)

Please format them like in Script.lua.]],
