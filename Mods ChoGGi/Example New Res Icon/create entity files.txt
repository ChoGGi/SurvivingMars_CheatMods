Install ECM, and install the HelperMod included in it.
Stick any images you want to convert in AppData/Logos.
Use this command in SM, and it will place the converted images into your mod folder
ChoGGi.ComFuncs.ConvertImagesToResEntities("MOD_ID")

Important: you must copy the BackLight.dds into your Textures folder manually (as well as the Fallbacks one).
If your images are dark in-game that's why.
Thank Rusty for spending a day or two figuring that fun one out.





Any png files in AppData/Logos folder will be added to mod as converted logo files.
They have to be min of 8bit, and will be resized to power of 2.
ChoGGi.ComFuncs.ConvertImagesToResEntities("ChoGGi_ExampleNewResIcon")
to use .tga files, and the mod object instead of mod id
ChoGGi.ComFuncs.ConvertImagesToResEntities(Mods.ChoGGi_ExampleNewResIcon,".tga")
