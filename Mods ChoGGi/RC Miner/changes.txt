v1.6
Gagarin.

v1.5
Removed some console log spam.

v1.4
Refunds 1/2 amount of cost for building (instead of 5 Metals/Poly) on demo.

v1.3
1.2 Borked new rovers (it's cause you didn't buy enough card packs to elevate your gameplay).
In auto-mode the not working sign didn't get removed when moving to a new site.

Again buy card packs you leeches, this ain't no BF backing out on their commitment to suck you dry. We're FIFA all the way.
v1.2
Re-branded to RC Miner.

Now added Premium Mining:
Buy card packs to speed up mining.

5 cards for 4.99 USD.
11 cards for 9.99 USD.
501 cards for 499.999 USD (Best Value!).

No more waiting around for your loot, now you can build your premium custom base sooner!
