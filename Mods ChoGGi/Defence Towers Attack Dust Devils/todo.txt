Hey ChoGGi, so one thing I observed when using this mod is that, in a "Steep" Map, lets say the turret is in a lower elevation and if a dust devil comes up in a higher elevation, and if there is like a mountain range in between, the rocket cant seem hit the devil and hits the mountain range instead and it fails to stop it.

Any chance you make the trajectory more parabolic?
