When I do Ctrl + Left Click to toggle all buildings of that type, it will literally toggle. So say I have some wind turbines set OFF not to be maintained and I build some new ones which defaults as expected ON to be maintained, if I toggle all the new ones OFF using Ctrl + Left Click, the older ones will also toggle and get set to ON. This is not how vanilla behaviour works when you do Ctrl + Left Click on vanilla buttons (like Turn On/Off and Change Priority), where it will set all building types to the state you've just clicked on.
