Adds all the animals to the pasture breeds.
Mmmmm dog meat (not sure if I like A Boy and His Dog, but the ending is nice).

There's a mod option to open outside ranches when selected.

Yes, I know the tortoise does a conga line out the door, but I don't want to fix it.


For the non-pasture animals, I got lazy and copied stats (you can see from which in the tooltip).
Suggestions?
food, health, herd_size, air_consumption, water_consumption, and lifetime.
If you have Expanded Cheat Menu; use ~Animals in the console to see a list.
I'll take a description too :)


I can't put space llamas in a pasture since it has no walking animation.
