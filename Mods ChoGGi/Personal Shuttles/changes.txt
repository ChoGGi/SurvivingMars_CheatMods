v0.9
Update to my lib mod.

v0.8
Pick up button wasn't showing on objects unless two shuttles were spawned.
Added pick up option to waste rock.
If a recalled shuttle is carrying an object it'll drop it off nearby.
Restored old icons.
Two shuttles won't land in same pos (instead of 10+).
Drones no longer try to drive when getting a ride.

v0.7
Hides pickup item buttons if there's no shuttles out.
Gagarin messed up attacker colour.

v0.6
Library update.

v0.5
Sagan.
Added pick up/drop anims.
Nearby drones will use resources from moved piles.

v0.4
Just updating code to parity with ECM code and steam version.

v0.3
Curiosity update

v0.2
Changed:
Follower shuttles now break path when you move the mouse (they do get confused at times, figured decent tradeoff).
Removed pin option (it'll follow you around always, so not needed).
Follower shuttles show what they're carrying.
Only shows shuttle control button when it's a follower shuttle.
Follower shuttles now carry visible objects (ah yeah).
Follower shuttles will now only pick up one item at a time.

Fixed:
Shuttles were spamming error log because I made them pinnable.
Non-follower shuttles won't swing by and check out your cursor anymore.
