v0.4
Instead of completely shutting down grid, mod now tries to only shutdown switches on each side of the leak.

v0.3
If you have my Library mod then you can use the Ignore Switch button in the selection panel to stop certain switches from being automagically toggled.

v0.2
Made it try to partially reconnect grids.
