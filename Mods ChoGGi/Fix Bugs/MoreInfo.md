# Extra info for incorporated mods/specific fixes:


### Uneven terrain / Flatten tool

When finishing landscaping it can set some of the surrounding hexes z values (height) to 65535 (also known as UnbuildableZ).

Calling RefreshBuildableGrid() on the map seems to get rid of them without causing any major issues:

It can mark some hexes as okay to build when they weren't before, but nothing like a cliff side or anything.

If you enable the mod option and notice that you can build on some places you really shouldn't be able to then please let me know :)

If you're bored and want to dig through the funcs in LandscapeFinish() to find out exactly where it's coming from, feel free.

### No Planetary Anomaly Breakthroughs when B&B is installed

Mod option to disable this "fix" (and receive less Breakthroughs).

City:InitBreakThroughAnomalies() is called for each new city (surface/underground/asteroids).

Calling it more than once clears the BreakthroughOrder list.

BreakthroughOrder is used to spawn planetary anomalies.

### Fix Deposits Wrong Map

If you scan a surface sector that has a concrete deposit while underground then the deposit will appear underground.
This will check on load for borked ones and move them to the surface, as well as overriding the borked function to fix newly scanned.
This also fixes underground ones stuck on the surface (less likely).

If it doesn't remove them, then go to the mod options and press apply.

https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/surviving-mars-surface-concrete-deposit-has-no-icon-and-is-not-minable.1496572/

### Colonists underground crash

This will check for colonists underground that are trying to path to a place on the surface.

The game will crash when they run out of usable pathing.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingMars/comments/1k70uxf/game_crashing_on_the_same_sol_every_time/

v2: A different save and colonists on the surface stuck in underground labels (same mod option as previous fix).

v3: Third time is the charm, this crash was apprently newly arrived colonists going down the elevator instead of the arrival dome.

### Colonists showing up on wrong map in infobar

Disabled by default, can cause freezing when loading saves.

### No flying drones underground

Flying drones tend to get stuck in walls/etc, this makes them into regular ones underground (mod option).

For existing drones you'll need to recall them to their hubs and redeploy.

### The Bottomless Pit Anomaly is missing

SpawnAnomaly() calls FindUnobstructedDepositPos() which for whatever reason,

takes the pos from in front of the wonder and sticks it in the passage behind it... (BlankUnderground_02 map)

SpawnAnomaly() freaks out and changes it to an underground water instead (or just doesn't spawn it).

### Future Contemporary Asset Pack

When placing a building you can change skins, if you use the spire skins from this DLC when placing skins

then it blocks an extra hex (you can see it when placing). This removes that hex on new buildings.

### Fix Rover In Dome

Checks on load for rovers stuck in domes (not open air ones).

Also fixes drones stuck in pastures.

You can also use an expedition that needs a transport rover, make sure your other rovers aren't idle (moving around is enough).

### Fix FindDroneToRepair Log Spam

This seems to be an issue from flying drones and a drone hub being destroyed.

Your log will "fill" up with this error:

Mars/Lua/Units/Drone.lua(256): method FindDroneToRepair

### Fix Destroyed Tunnels Still Work

Rovers will still use destroyed tunnels (in certain situations).

https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/hello-can-you-address-this-little-issue.1463333

### Force heat grid to update

If you paused game on new game load then cold areas don't update till you get a working Subsurface Heater.

### Water Reclamation Spire and B&B

Some buildings don't properly turn off their upgrades which causes them to keep their modifiers on.

The "fix" is turning off upgrades when a building is demolished, turned off, malfunctioned (might be annoying, mod option to keep it as is).

### Fix Buildings Broken Down And No Repair

If you have broken down buildings the drones won't repair. This will check for them on load game.

The affected buildings will say something about exceptional circumstances.

Any buildings affected by this issue will need to be repaired with 000.1 resource after the fix happens.

This also has a fix for buildings hit with lightning during a cold wave.

### Fix Floating Rubble

Move any floating underground rubble to within reach of drones (might have to "push" drones to make them go for it).

### Fix Colonist Daily Interest Loop

A colonist will repeatedly use a daily interest building to satisfy a daily interest already satisfied.

Repeating a daily interest can gain a comfort boost "if" colonist comfort is below the service comfort threshold, but a resource will always be consumed each visit.

This mod will block the colonist from having a visit (i.e., an unemployed scientist will wander around outside till the Sol is over instead of chewing up 0.6 electronics).

https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/surviving-mars-colonists-repeatedly-satisfy-daily-interests.1464969/

Thanks to ThereWillBeBugsToOvercome for noticing it, finding the offending code, doing a detailed write up of it, and testing the fix.

### Fix Stuck Malfunctioning Drones At DroneHub

If you have malfunctioning drones at a dronehub and they never get repaired (off map).

This'll check on load each time for them (once should be enough though), and move them near the hub.

### Fix Farm Oxygen

If you remove a farm that has an oxygen producing crop (workers not needed) the oxygen will still count in the dome.

### Fix Dust Devils Block Building

No more cheesing dust devils with waste rock depots (etc), by placing them on top of said devils (not by building them to block them).

### Fix Defence Towers Not Firing At Rovers

It's from a mystery (trying to keep spoilers to a minimum).

If you're starting a new game than this is fixed, but for older saves on this mystery you'll need this mod.

### Fix Landscaping Freeze

When LandscapeMark hits 4095 bad things happen.

This checks each new day and resets LandscapeLastMark to whatever is the highest number in Landscapes (assuming it's under 3000, otherwise 0).

For those wondering LandscapeLastMark is increased each time you open flatten/ramp (doesn't need to be placed).

Thanks to Quirquie for the bug report (and persistence).

### Fix Unrepairable Attack Rovers

Allows Attack Rovers to be repaired when you can't repair them.

I don't want to say too much as they're from one of the mysteries.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingMars/comments/12vkbrb/

### Fix Unlock RC Safari Resupply

RC Safaris aren't automagically unlocked in the resupply screen for games saved before Tito/Tourism update.

### Pins Missing Some Status Icons

The pinned rover transport buttons are missing un/load icons.



# Known Bugs:
Mars Nouveau won't count if you remove a Construction site and place the new one in the exact same position (thanks Dark Master).
