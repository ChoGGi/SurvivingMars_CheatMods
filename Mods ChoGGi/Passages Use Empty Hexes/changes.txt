v0.6
Cleaned up the text.

v0.5
Show hexes for Capital City.

v0.4
Fix for bug last (non) update.

v0.3
Added mod option: Show usable hexes: Show hexes that can connect domes when placing passages.
Press numpad 6 to toggle showing usable hexes.

v0.2
You can now place passages at the life-support/entrance areas, so you can use pretty much any dome.
Manual kinks don't work when you use them though...
