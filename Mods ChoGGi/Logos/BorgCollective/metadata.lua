	"description", "[h1][b]We are the borg. Resistance is futile.[/b][/h1]\n\nLed by the Queen hivemind, the Borg are mixed species of cybernetically enhanced organisims originating from Unimatrix Zero in the Delta Quadrant. Starfleet encounters led to the coining of the term Borg Collective. As indicated, the Borg are an alien adversary from the Star Trek universe. Surviving Mars should be a cinch if your colony already bears this insignia.\n\n\"We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.[b][url=http://stexpanded.wikia.com/wiki/Borg]\"[/url][/b]\n\nCredit for creation and implementation for Surviving Mars belongs to [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChoGGi/]ChoGGi[/url][/b].
