99 different logos in all (and you thought one Space Communism logo was enough).
If you're on the other side of the fence, see my sister mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1756589972]Hakenkreuz Logos[/url].

You can use my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1815122803]Change Logo[/url] mod to change the logo of an existing game.
