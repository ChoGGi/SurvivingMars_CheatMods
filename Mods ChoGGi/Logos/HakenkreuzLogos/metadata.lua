If you're on the other side of the fence, see my sister mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502077662]Commie Mars Logos[/url].

You can use my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1815122803]Change Logo[/url] mod to change the logo of an existing game, or my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2206869172]Random Rocket Logo[/url] mod.
