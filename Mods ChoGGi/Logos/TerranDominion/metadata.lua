Long live the Terran Dominion.[/b][/h1]\n\nIn the 26th Century the UED along with the Confederacy have been obliterated and Arcturus Mengsk stands at the forefront of Terran unity. In unity lies strength. This fictitious dictatorial regime is from the world of StarCraft. StarCraft is Blizzard Entertainment's premier RTS game which initially released in 1998. Take Mars for us Terrans and make Mengsk proud.\n\n\"For only together shall we succeed. Only together shall we triumph. Only together shall we overcome. That is why we fight.[b][url=http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Terran_Dominion]\"[/url][/b]\n\nCredit for creation and implementation for Surviving Mars belongs to [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChoGGi/]ChoGGi[/url][/b].
