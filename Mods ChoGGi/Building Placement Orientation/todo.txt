For placing large number of triangular buildings, eg. large solar panels,
it would be useful to have an option to rotate the building one step after each placement.

A possibly conflicting thought is that it would be nifty to track rotation of individual buildings separately,
so that placing a set of building x, y, and z, each with a different orientation doesn't involve rotating them over and over again.
