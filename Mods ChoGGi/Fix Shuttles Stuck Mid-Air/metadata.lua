This only checks for them on load, if it's a common occurrence for you then send me a msg.

This waits in between sending each one home, else they may just get stuck again...
If it's been over a minute then upload your save file somewhere, so I can take a look-see.

You can disable/remove it afterwards (or at least till the next time it happens).]],
