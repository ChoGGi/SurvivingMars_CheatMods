v0.9
Added limit to number of breakthroughs (needs lib v10.9).

v0.8
table.append > table.iappend (thanks for the heads up devs).

v0.7
It wasn't finding all that it should.

v0.6
Added coordinates to map data for easier searching.

v0.5
Added input for ignoring text.
Finding maps is faster (slightly slower initial load).

Removed Cancel button (it's kinda useless).

v0.3
Added info button to show some text.

v0.2
use Tab and Shift-Tab to move between text inputs.
