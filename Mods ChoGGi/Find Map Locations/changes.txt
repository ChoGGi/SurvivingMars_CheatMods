Search previous results instead of all map data.

It didn't find anything (thanks Inertial Mage).

v1.0
Updated to parity with my Lib mod.

v0.9
Added limit to number of breakthroughs (needs lib v10.9).

table.append > table.iappend (thanks for the heads up devs).

v0.7
It wasn't finding all that it should.

v0.6
Added coordinates to map data for easier searching.

Finding maps is faster (slightly slower initial load).

use Tab and Shift-Tab to move between text inputs.
