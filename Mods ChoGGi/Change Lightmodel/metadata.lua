If you don't want the oversaturated look to the map when you terraform far enough (or if you always want it).

[b]Terraformed[/b] is the "Blue Skies" progress of the Green Planet DLC.
[b]TheMartian[/b] is the standard lightmodel.
The rest are whatever is included (I would guess Curiosity is from an older update called Curiosity).
Only turn on the lightmodel you want to use.

This won't override the lightmodels during certain mysteries/dust storms/cold waves/rain.
It may take a few in-game hours to change over.
