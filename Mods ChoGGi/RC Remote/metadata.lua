Press E to jump forward. It ignores pathing, so you can use it to get up/down hillsides.
Press Q to fire a missile at the mouse cursor object (useful for removing rocks).
All the keys are re-bindable in the game controls.

Known Issues:
I override keyboard controls to use WASD, To get back control select something else (rocks will work).
