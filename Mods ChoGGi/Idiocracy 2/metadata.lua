I don't see the devs ever updating [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1331558393]this[/url] (esp. since they've been with another publisher for a good year).


This mod adds a new mission sponsor - "Idiocracy", supplemented with a colony logo (new commander added as well).
Under "Idiocracy" all colonists have the Idiot trait, there is no Sponsor research and no technologies are unlocked at start.
