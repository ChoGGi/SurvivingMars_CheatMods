a) could you add male/female count, and behind people in the selected list? also a total how many male/female?
b) add info who is a tourist for each person on the list? also a total how many will be tourists
c) currently people count per role doesnt work in combination with escort mod  see screenshot left side
d) change the mod option to default all 3 settings to on so it gets used by default when you enable the mod?
e) where is the point in tourists having a specialization if they dont work? (maybe another mod - make tourist a specialization of its own, it is quite stupid currently?)
