### Blacklist bypass mod for Surviving Mars mods

```
Find and rename LocalStorage.lua to LocalStorage_Settings.lua

It's located in your game profile, see here to find it:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1777493789

Then you can move "LocalStorage.lua" and "BinAssets" to the profile folder (see AppData).

This will allow ECM to bypass the blacklist added in the Da Vinci update.
```


##### For new users
```
Your old ECM settings will need to be manually moved from LocalStorage to CheatMenuModSettings
```


##### Modders:
```
If you add a file with your steam id to the Mod Ids, then it will also work for yours.
A warning will be added to the mod manager to any mods without the blacklist active.
```
