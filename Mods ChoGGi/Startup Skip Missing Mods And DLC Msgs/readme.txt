Find and rename LocalStorage.lua to LocalStorage_Settings.lua

It's located in your game profile, see here to find it:

Then you can move "LocalStorage.lua" and "BinAssets" to the profile folder

See Install Help.png


Symlinking:
If you symlink the BinAssets folder, you won't need to update HelperMod manually.
Though HelperMod shouldn't be updated too often.



For those previously using the HelperMod:
Move the BinAssets folder to the appdata folder to keep any mods/settings.
