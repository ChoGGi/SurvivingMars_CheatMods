v1.0
Sagan.

v0.9
Intergrated with my HelperMod for ECM (easier to have the two both installed).
v0.8
Added the options from Skip Missing Mods & DLC Msgs (commented out).
v0.7
Now retrieves the correct Assets Revision, so no more need for version bumping.
v0.6
revision bump for Curiosity
v0.4
Added commented out option to skip the missing/outdated mods warning message
v0.3
bumped revision for Spirit
v0.2
Turns out starting a new game gives a blank map 
You need to pass a somewhat correct revision 
It's stored in Packs\BinAssets.hpk, or just check the log 
It'll say Assets revision: 17650 (17000 works fine for now, I assume when it goes over 18000...)
