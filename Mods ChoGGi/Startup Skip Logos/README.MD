### This needs to be placed in the game folder for Surviving Mars
### NOT in AppData\Surviving Mars (see Install Help.png)

```
Surviving Mars\BinAssets\AssetsRevision.lua

This'll skip both logos at startup, and skips two of the mod manager warning msgs.

I also included an option (commented out) to skip straight to the load menu.
You can still get back to the main menu.

##### OSX Install Help (thanks BodyByBuddha)
```
- Expand the zip & you'll see a BinAssets folder & this readme file.
- Move the BinAssets folder to /Applications/Surviving Mars.app/Contents/Resources

If you are using Finder, to open the Surviving Mars.app, right click on the application icon and select Show Package Contents.
```
