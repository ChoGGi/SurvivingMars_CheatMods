This adds a button to the HUD (bottom right), to test/save/clear a saved margin.
When you find one that works for your resolution then please send me your res width and margin, so I can add it to the mod.

Mod margin settings are:
5760x1080 (48:9): 2560

Options in HUD button:
Test Margin: Enter a margin value without it being saved (right-click button to open directly).
Save Margin: Same as test, but also saves it (use 0 to never have any margin).
Clear Saved Setting: Removes saved setting (this will still check mod margin setting next time).
Use Mod Setting: Tries to use mod margin setting (also happens when game is started, saved setting overrides).



Known Issues:
This just fixes the in-game HUD, I didn't bother with anything else.
Some stuff isn't centred: blue pause overlay, console, console log, and cheat menu.]],
