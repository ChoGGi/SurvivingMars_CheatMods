Rovers will not do automated tasks when a meteor storm is active.
Such as collecting the goodies that just dropped from the sky.

They'll finish up whatever task they're on then aim for the nearest working laser/missile tower/drone hub (in that order)

MDS Laser: Go to the nearest working laser/missile tower if rover is idle.
Drone Hub: Go to the nearest working drone hub if rover is idle.
Immediate Abort: As soon as storm starts rovers will flee/idle (default off).
