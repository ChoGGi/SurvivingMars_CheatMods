v0.5
Added an Image checkbox (does the same as the MCR option).
It'll work without MCR, but it won't save the setting.

v0.4
Library update.

v0.3
Added Double Size and Reset Dialog buttons for fiddling with dialog.

v0.2
Takes a screenshot of the map the first time you open it.
Only works decently for 16:9, there's a ModConfig option to use the topo images like v0.1.
Adds a toggle controls button, use it to set opacity/manually update image.
