v0.7
Evans update.

v0.6
Library update.

v0.5
Added an Image checkbox (does the same as the mod option).
It'll work without mod options, but it won't save the setting.

v0.4
Library update.

v0.3
Added Double Size and Reset Dialog buttons for fiddling with dialog.

v0.2
Takes a screenshot of the map the first time you open it.
Only works decently for 16:9, there's a mod option to use the topo images like v0.1.
Adds a toggle controls button, use it to set opacity/manually update image.
