v0.4
Library update.

v0.3
Added Double Size and Reset Dialog buttons for fiddling with dialog.

v0.2
Takes a screenshot of the map the first time you open it.
Only works decently for 16:9, there's a ModConfig option to use the topo images like v0.1.
Adds a toggle controls button, use it to set opacity/manually update image.
