v0.6
Library update.

v0.5
Sagan.
Added the nine new maps (re-did all of them just in case of differences).
There's no point in having the position in the title bar, so removed.
v0.4
Made the map size based on uiscale.
The map defaults to the right-side.
Added position to title bar.
Cleaning up code (ChoGGi's Library).
v0.3
As best I can tell some other mod is also using the same function, so I added a check for when a game is started to just skip showing the image.
v0.2
Made it stop the image from showing up once you start a new game.
