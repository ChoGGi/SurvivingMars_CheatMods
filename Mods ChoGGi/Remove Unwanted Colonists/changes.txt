v1.3
Possible fix for missing mod options (mods making old traits).

v1.2
Maybe fixed gray cube as pod.
Made idiot monument fit into one hex and not float (I can add old style as mod option if wanted).

v1.1
Added mod option to never remove tourists.

v1.0
Added flying around sound to murder pods.
Random delay before idiot looks at idiot monument.
Victims name is shown in selection panel for pod.

v0.9
Localed something that should'nt have been global.

v0.8
Log spam.

v0.7
Added positive traits to filter list.

v0.6
Added mod options to automagically remove colonists of certain traits (age, negative, other).
I can add positive if anyone wants, just figured it wasn't something most people want...

v0.5
Doesn't remove colonists in passages (thanks Gunny).

v0.4
Now checks for the monument if it has yet to be built.
Adds selection arrow to victim when you select the pod.

v0.3
Added a buildable outside monument for "selected" victims
Once a victim is "selected" they'll head straight for it.

v0.2
The pod blinked out of existence instead of flying away.
The rocket fx wasn't turned on.
Widened the radius it'll use to hover around waiting.
Fixed issue if pod arrived and victim was in a building.
