v0.5
Doesn't remove colonists in passages (thanks Gunny).

v0.4
Now checks for the monument if it has yet to be built.
Adds selection arrow to victim when you select the pod.

v0.3
Added a buildable outside monument for "selected" victims
Once a victim is "selected" they'll head straight for it.

v0.2
The pod blinked out of existence instead of flying away.
The rocket fx wasn't turned on.
Widened the radius it'll use to hover around waiting.
Fixed issue if pod arrived and victim was in a building.
