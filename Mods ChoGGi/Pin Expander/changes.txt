v0.6
It seems I stopped this from working when I changed some stuff in my Library mod for auto-hiding popups.
Made sure green sphere will disappear after popup closes.

v0.5
Library update.

v0.4
Cleaning up code (ChoGGi's Library).

v0.3
Clicking a rocket will work properly now.
Non-spawned rockets are now hidden from view.

v0.2
Faster (3K+ colonists takes 1-2 seconds).

Limited Colonists to same dome if over 5000.
Hold Shift to show full list.

More icons (see tooltip for "interpretation" of what each icon is for, English only).
if list under 50 then add anything in same build category.
Always groups Domes and Rovers.
Hold Ctrl for old pin button functionality (might not work with a gamepad, but only console users would sink to that level).
