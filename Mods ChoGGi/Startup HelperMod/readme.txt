You need to copy BinAssets to the SM program file folder (SteamApps\common\Surviving Mars)

To find the folder:
Open the Steam client.
Right-click Surviving Mars.
Go to Properties>Local Files>Browse Local Files.
Paste BinAssets into that folder.

If you did it correctly ECM will no longer have a version compatibility issue.
(See Install Help.png)



Symlinking:
If you symlink the BinAssets folder, you won't need to update HelperMod manually.
HelperMod shouldn't be updated too often, but hopefully the devs ease up on the blacklisting, and I can remove it.
