This is needed for certain blacklisted functions in Da Vinci update and beyond.
Most people will not need to use this, modders may find it useful for testing.


Find and rename LocalStorage.lua to LocalStorage_Settings.lua

It's located in your game profile, see here to find it:

Then you can move "LocalStorage.lua" and "BinAssets" to the profile folder (see AppData).

See Install Help.png

For new users:
Your old ECM settings will need to be manually moved from LocalStorage to CheatMenuModSettings


Symlinking:
If you symlink the BinAssets folder, you won't need to update HelperMod manually.
Though HelperMod shouldn't be updated too often.
