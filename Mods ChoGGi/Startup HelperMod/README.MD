### This needs to be placed in the game folder for Surviving Mars
### NOT in AppData\Surviving Mars (see Install Help.png)

```
Surviving Mars\BinAssets\AssetsRevision.lua

This will allow ECM to bypass the blacklist added in the Da Vinci update (reverts to Curiosity and below permissions).
```

##### Modders:
```
If you add a file with your steam id to the Mod Ids, then it will also work for yours.
A warning will be added to the mod manager to any mods without the blacklist active.
```

##### OSX Install Help (thanks BodyByBuddha)
```
- Expand the zip & you'll see a BinAssets folder & this readme file.
- Move the BinAssets folder to /Applications/Surviving Mars.app/Contents/Resources

If you are using Finder, to open the Surviving Mars.app, right click on the application icon and select Show Package Contents.
```
