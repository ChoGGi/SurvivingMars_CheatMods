If you're feeling OCD about a perfect layout for your base then look no further.

Press Shift-F to begin, press Shift-F again to update buildable area.
Press Ctrl-Shift-1 to remove large rocks, Ctrl-Shift-2 for small ones (shows a confirmation before).
Ctrl-Shift-Alt-D to delete object under mouse (any object and there's no confirmation).

You can rebind keys with the in-game options (scroll to the bottom).

There's a hard limit on how close to the edge you can build (I'll probably figure that out one of these days), so I wouldn't bother flattening the border mountains.
