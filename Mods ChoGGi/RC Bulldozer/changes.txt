v0.4
Rover isn't shy of bumpy ground anymore.
Added popup list to Texture button.
Got rid of the persist error that shows up in the log when you save a game (doesn't affect gameplay).

v0.3
Only updates buildable ground when you turn off dozing (instead of each time it stops moving).

v0.2
Changed texture to one that doesn't paint over landing site.
Slowed down the flatten loop a tad (easier on cpu usage).
