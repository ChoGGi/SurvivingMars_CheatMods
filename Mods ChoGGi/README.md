### No warranty implied or otherwise!

##### OutdoorDomeBuildings
```
Add dome buildings outdoors (dome service buildings still need to be near domes).
doesn't mean they'll work properly, but they look nice.
Made Spires buildable in other spaces in domes (can't build them in spire place)< Thank you BoehserOnkel
```

### All the rest are included in CheatMod_CheatMenu, but if you want them then...

##### DefensiveTurret
```
A laser-targeting defense structure. Protect nearby buildings from meteors. Can attack enemy vehicles at extreme range.
enemy vehicles sounds like dlc? :)
```

##### HiddenBuildings
```
Add hidden buildings to build menu...Warning: The ones in the "Hidden" category may break your game...
The Rocket Landing Site will break selection if you select it, so you'll need to manually uncomment it in items.lua (it's useless anyways).
Added a * to the names, to distinguish from the normal ones.
```

##### SanatoriumCureAll
```
Sanatoriums cure all negative traits, and Sanatorium+ treats 12 instead of 4 people at a time
Press F4 to toggle showing the full list of traits for it.
```

##### StopChildBirths
```
No more children born (maybe, untested)
```

##### NewColonistsYouth
```
Turns all born/sent from Earth Colonists into youths (no more dealing with children).
```

##### UnlimitedWonders
```
Add as many wonders as you want (the space elevator doesn't like it when there's more than one).
Added a * to the names, to distinguish from the normal ones.
```

##### AddFunding
```
Add 10M each time you load your game (open up items.lua to add another zero or two). You can load it once, save, then disable the mod.
```

##### UnlockResearch
```
Has a list of all research/breakthroughs, open items.lua and uncomment the ones you want to unlock (some names have spaces/misspelling, that's just how they are). Load the game and it'll unlock it, you can then disable it or just leave it enabled it doesn't matter.
You can change GrantTech to DiscoverTech, if you want to research it instead.
```

##### EnableCheats
```
Add a cheat section to the selection pane on the right (careful pressing malfunction, or emptying a mine), and a bunch of other cheats (commented out, see items.lua).
It'll allow you to fill up rockets with supplies, restock surface rock formations, quick build anything, etc.

Use the Cheat menu instead
```

##### AllPositiveTraits
```
Add all positive traits to ColonistArrived/ColonistBorn, and removes all negative.
If you already have people, and you want to apply this to them then open Script.lua and uncomment the function at the bottom (may be laggy on large colonies so I left it disabled).
```

##### LargerScannerQueue
```
Queue up all the squares instead of 5.
```

##### LargerResearchQueue
```
Queue up 25.
```
