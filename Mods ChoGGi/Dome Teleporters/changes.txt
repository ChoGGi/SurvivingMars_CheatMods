v0.5
Forgot to add the msg about getting my Library mod.

v0.4
Forgot to move a line up, so you had to wait for the unit to leave the port before they'd grow.
Units now enter/leave from the platform instead of the entrance.
Exiting porter picks a random angle to drop off unit.
Also made it so the light anim doesn't play more than once at a time.
Remove ruins button didn't show up.

v0.3
Build dist was no good for values under 100.

v0.2
Build dist MC option wasn't working (thanks BGR).
