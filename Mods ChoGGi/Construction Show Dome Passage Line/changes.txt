v1.3
Sped it up (tested on 140 domes).

v1.2
Checks for Construction Extend Length and Longer Passages Tech mods and uses the extended length.

v1.1
Evans update.

v1.0
Shortened max length by two to be able to fit triangle dome corners.
Added mod option to Adjust Line Length.

v0.9
Parabola ftw.

v0.8
Added mod option to disable it.

v0.7
Thought I got all the marker objects, guess not.

v0.6
Mod left marker objects in game, so you'd get some console spam if you removed it from a save.
Wouldn't cause problems, just the spam.

v0.5
Hex marks are coloured green to make them distinct from dome marks.
Raised the height of my marks just above dome marks.
Marks are updated when you rotate a dome.
Marks show up on construction sites.
Since you can rebuild ruins, it'll also mark them as well (if it's a horrid notion to you then I can add a mod options option)...

v0.4
Da Vinci

v0.3
Added hex markers instead of just an arrow.
Uses shape data instead of spot names to place markers.

v0.2
Slightly faster for large amounts of domes.
Ignores dome ruins.
