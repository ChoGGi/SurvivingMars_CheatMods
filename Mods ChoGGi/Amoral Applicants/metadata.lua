Once the food runs out on an orbiting rocket, rather than just killing everyone off; applicants start getting hungry, and applicants start disappearing.
If the rocket makes it down before the leftovers run out, a new trait is added which will result in a daily sanity loss.

Mod Options:
Daily Sanity Loss: How many sanity is lost each day after landing on Mars (cannibals only...).
Daily Colonist Loss: How many longpigs are cooked up for the Lūʻau.
Max Feeding Time/Min Feeding Time: Time in hours between feeding (once a rocket is in orbit; it's time is set).


The image of course has nothing to do with the mod. You should go watch the movie, maybe have a nice juicy steak while doing so?]],
