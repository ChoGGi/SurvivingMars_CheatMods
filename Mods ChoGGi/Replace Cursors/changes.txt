v0.5
Da Vinci
Switched to Black borders from Grayscale.
v0.4
Changed cursors to grayscale (hopefully still fixes issue). See Mod folder\Replacements.
Mod now checks SM profile folder\Cursors for custom cursors.
Changes loading icon (not immediately).
v0.3
Forgot to test on a new game (it also doesn't work for some of the cmd center buttons, but I stopped caring).
v0.2
Missed some HUD elements.
