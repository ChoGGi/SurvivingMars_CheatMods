Or just to have different cursors.

Cursors are stored in mod folder/Cursors.

To use custom cursors (won't be removed when this mod is updated):
Copy cursors to your profile folder\Cursors, like so:

Windows: %APPDATA%\Surviving Mars\Cursors
macOS/OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/Surviving Mars/Cursors
Linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/Surviving Mars/Cursors

See mod folder/Replacements for some to use.

Thanks to nadrolinux for figuring out cursors that work.

devs are aware of the issue, so hopefully those that use this to fix the transparency issue won't have to wait too many updates.
