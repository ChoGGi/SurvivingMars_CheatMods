v0.5
Da Vinci
v0.4
Changed:
.log(number,NaN) would assume NaN was Napier's constant, now it errors out.
.maxinteger/.mininteger now use max_int/min_int instead of the values from lua console.

Fixed:
.ceil() was off for negative numbers with a few decimal place digits.

v0.3
Fixed: .fmod(), .modf(), .log(), .random(n).
More unit testing.
Removed lua.exe, use https://github.com/HazeProductions/Lua-x64.
Slightly more useful error msgs.

v0.2
More type checking.
Errors when input is NaN (instead of returning "-nan(ind)").
Better .random() output.
.ult() works according to manual now.
Added .test() for some unit testing.
Added a few deprecated functions.
