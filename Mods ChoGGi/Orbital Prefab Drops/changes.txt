v0.5
Uses supply pod model now.
It now takes back off after prefab is setup.
No more falling rockets.
It doesn't do passages anymore, since they're a bit off hex.
Added  a ModConfig option for the model.

v0.4
Dropping into a dome will crack it (turn off with ModConfig).

v0.3
Container slides down while prefab slides up.
Added a bottom to the container.
Changed size of ground damage decals (rockets now smaller vs container).
Whoops seems the rockets do cause damage :), added ModConfig option (default off).
Also stopped the containers from doing damage.

v0.2
Halved the amount of rockets attached to containers.

ModConfig options
Inside/Outside buildings: If you don't want them being dropped off inside (or outside).
Prefab Only: Only rocket drop prefabs (or all buildings dependant on above options).
Detach Rockets: Rockets will detach and fall to the ground (the rockets are just visual, no damage will happen).
Detach Rockets Passages: Blocks the rockets detaching for passages (gets quite busy).

Defaults are PrefabOnly = true,Outside = true,Inside = false,DetachRockets = true,DetachRocketsPassages = false

I did have to block pipes/cables from rockets as they're a little buggy.
