v0.2
Halved the amount of rockets attached to containers.

ModConfig options
Inside/Outside buildings: If you don't want them being dropped off inside (or outside).
Prefab Only: Only rocket drop prefabs (or all buildings dependant on above options).
Detach Rockets: Rockets will detach and fall to the ground (the rockets are just visual, no damage will happen).
Detach Rockets Passages: Blocks the rockets detaching for passages (gets quite busy).

Defaults are PrefabOnly = true,Outside = true,Inside = false,DetachRockets = true,DetachRocketsPassages = false

I did have to block pipes/cables from rockets as they're a little buggy.
