v0.7
Issues when saving/loading a game during a drop off.

v0.6
Added other pod entity from gagarin.
Added dust to like with rockets (half the radius).

v0.5
Uses supply pod model now.
It now takes back off after prefab is setup.
No more falling rockets.
It doesn't do passages anymore, since they're a bit off hex.
Added a mod options option for the model.

v0.4
Dropping into a dome will crack it (turn off with mod options).

v0.3
Container slides down while prefab slides up.
Added a bottom to the container.
Changed size of ground damage decals (rockets now smaller vs container).
Whoops seems the rockets do cause damage :), added mod options option (default off).
Also stopped the containers from doing damage.

v0.2
Halved the amount of rockets attached to containers.

mod options options
Inside/Outside buildings: If you don't want them being dropped off inside (or outside).
Prefab Only: Only rocket drop prefabs (or all buildings dependant on above options).
Detach Rockets: Rockets will detach and fall to the ground (the rockets are just visual, no damage will happen).
Detach Rockets Passages: Blocks the rockets detaching for passages (gets quite busy).

Defaults are PrefabOnly = true,Outside = true,Inside = false,DetachRockets = true,DetachRocketsPassages = false

I did have to block pipes/cables from rockets as they're a little buggy.
