This changes all your stored info to the info for Haemimont Games and/or the CEO (thanks Google).

This changes g_ParadoxHashedUserId... Which might be used for cloud saves (thanks SkiRich), but I don't have the bandwidth/time to have it upload 40MB saves all the time, so I don't care.
This also blocks a couple functions that list steam friends/blocked users.

You can also copy and paste Script.lua into one of my AssetsRevision.lua mods to have it set before any mods load.

I'm still not sure why a mod should need to access any of this info...
