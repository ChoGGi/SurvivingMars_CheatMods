##### OSX Install Help (thanks BodyByBuddha)
```
- Expand the zip & you'll see a BinAssets folder & this readme file.
- Move the BinAssets folder to /Applications/Surviving Mars.app/Contents/Resources

If you are using Finder, to open the Surviving Mars.app, right click on the application icon and select Show Package Contents.
