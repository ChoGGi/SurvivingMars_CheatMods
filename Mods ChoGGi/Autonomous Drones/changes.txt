v0.9
A very stupid bug... (prefabs work now)

v0.8
Tito.

v0.7
Stopped using prefabs for transfer since something I'm doing must be copying them instead of moving.
Drones now shrink then appear at new hub.
Merged Sort/Random mod options.
Removed some log spam.
Re-fangled code.

v0.6
New mod option Ignore Unused Hubs.
Fixed issue with single hubs.
Extra prefabs left over will be used at low load hubs.
Turning off Randomise Hub List will sort drones by load.
Drone Work Delay: How many "seconds" to wait before forcing the busy drone (0 to disable and wait).

v0.5
UseDronePrefab() doesn't check if you have prefabs.

v0.4
Early game mod option to evenly split drones across all controllers.
Tweaked how drones are assigned (hopefully reduces the 0 drones hub).

v0.3
Mod options to choose which controllers to use for assignment.

v0.2
Choose between Hour/Sol.
Slight speed up.
