- Entity Spawner has a checkbox to activate any auto-attach entities.
- Added some cheats for the beta.
- ECM tries to use ConsoleRules if it's a global table, otherwise does the usual.
- Examine: Added value type to tooltip title.
- Updated the Monitor Threads/Tables funcs to use the auto-refresh delay of the examine dialog.
- rawget doesn't work like it should for users without HelperMod, so I disabled the "Attempt to use an undefined global" "error".
	- Otherwise ECM will spam the console log (it'll still print the msg, just not as an error).

### Fixed:
- ECM was breaking saving functions in the mod editor.
- Find Value didn't work with strings containing %.
- Examine:
	- Context menu: Switched from using periods to brackets for stuff with . and such in the key.
	- Crash when examining objects using the "InvisibleObject" entity.

## v13.2 (17 Mar 2019)
### Added:
- Preliminary Xbox Support (thanks to Gnith for testing).
	- Certain stuff had to be disabled (the editor crashes the game, so no terrain editing).
	- Examine and console buttons don't work, and reading the file log probably is a no-go.

## v13.1 (15 Mar 2019)
### Changed:
- I cleaned up the console output too much last update.
- Examine:
	- Cleaned up the Entity Spots Toggle to separate the autoattach items better (no more massive dome text).

### Fixed:
- Examine>Objects>Hex Spots Toggle broke.

## v13.0 (14 Mar 2019)
### Changed:
- Debug>Force Story Bits shows full list instead of just "actively waiting" ones.
- Renamed Attach Spots List/Attach Spots Toggle to Entity Spots/Entity Spots Toggle.
- Entity Spots now returns a proper looking .ent file (as well as showing states).
- Hides Cheats menu quickbar when there's no items (for the OCD annoyed by that small white square).
- Examine:
	- Added Toolbar>Toggle Objlist: Toggle setting the metatable for this table to an objlist (for using mark/delete all).
	- Added a Skip Clear to the Object>Toggle funcs: Instead of removing info objs each time this will leave them.
	- Added to Context menu: Clipboard, Number Double/Halve, Boolean Toggle/To Table.
	- Objects menu will show up as long as it's a valid entity (IsValid doesn't work for some attachments).
	- Added more entries to Get Mat Props, also added sub materials.
	- Any string item with an image string in it will be displayed in the context menu tooltip.

### Fixed:
- Test Locale File would freeze on certain malformed strings (same as SM does).
- Clone Object didn't work well on colonists.
- Debug>Force Story Bits works properly now.
- Cleaned up the console prints happening since last update.
- Examine:
	- Tools>Functions failed on some objects.
	- Colonists use a different func to get the entity, so it now shows that (instead of "Male" for everyone).
	- It didn't check extra args for properness (sending it a func call that returned a bunch of args caused issues).

## v12.9 (10 Mar 2019)
### Added:
- Game>Terrain Texture Remap: Instead of replacing all textures with one then re-adding stuff, this will remap existing textures.
- Console>Tools>Examine Errors: Open (some) errors in an examine dialog (shows stack trace and sometimes a thread).
	- Useful if you want to use "Errors In Console" without the log showing.
- Debug>Test Locale File: Test a CSV for malformed strings (which may cause freezing when loaded normally).
- Debug>Used Terrain Textures: Show a list of terrain textures used in current map.

### Changed:
- Debug>Force Story Bits works, you'll need to pick a contextual object to use.
- Renamed Change Terrain Type to Terrain Texture Change.
- Figured out how to apply custom rules to console with blacklist, so now everyone can use ~obj (and such).
- Re-added Pack option to mod upload with a warning that it'll sometimes crash SM for no reason.
- Shift-F4/Ctrl-F4 doesn't return attachments to objects in list.
- Examine:
	- The list now shows "rawer" text, the fancy images/colours text is now shown in the tooltip.
	- Added entity name to objects with one.
	- Cleaned up Set Particles: No more dupes, and should hpoefully be better at turning them off
	- Attach Spots Toggle now shows the pos offset from origin, instead of world pos.
	- Added ExamineColourBoolFalse setting for false boolean to distinguish from true (green).
	- Added a "Generate .mtl" link to Object>Materials Properties (it doesn't have all the prop names yet).
	- Added Mark All Objects (Line) button: When examining an objlist of objs/points will show a line connecting them all.
	- Added a Material Properties option to the context menu.
	- If examine fails to parse the text, it'll show it in a text box.

### Fixed:
- Terrain Texture Change was hiding waste sites.
- Colonists names were only displaying the first name.
- Examine:
	- The search box will now search the entire line instead of chunks of it.
	- Toggle Attach Spots didn't always add the polyline to chains.
	- View Text: Broke scrolling when I removed the * from the text.

### Fixed:
- Examine:
	- The search box will now search the entire line instead of chunks of it.
	- Toggle Attach Spots didn't always add the polyline to chains.

### Removed:
- Fixes>All Pipe Skins To Default: It wasn't the best code, and I'm pretty sure they fixed the bug with chrome pipes?

	- Added Surfaces Toggle: Show a list of surfaces and draw lines over them (GetRelativeSurfaces).
	- Attaches menu shows what object the attachment is attached to.
	- Valid objects now show a bit more info and a link to the (cleaned up) paths.

- Console:
	- Added a new menu "Tools".
	- Moved some stuff from Settings and Examine to Tools.
	- Added Tools>Monitor Func Calls: Collects a list of func calls from "@AppData/Mods/".

### Fixed:
- Examining "_G" and closing the examine dlg would spam the log.
- Borken menuitems (if you find one that doesn't do anything let me know... log helps).
- Colonist>Set Gender wasn't working.
- Mission>Instant Colony Approval didn't remove the founder msg.
- Some of the infopanel cheats were hidden.
- Ctrl-Shift wasn't placing the last placed building (for rovers).

### Removed:

### Added:

	- Changed some of the "Flags" list to be toggleable.

### Fixed:
- Delete Object didn't work with filled Mech Depots (thanks FirstGeekDanny).

- Select the item you want to pick up and press "Ignore" so it toggles to Pickup,
- Leave it selected and the mouseover it, the shuttle will come and pick it up.
- Move to where you want to drop it, and change the shuttle to "Drop Item" (from pickup) and select an item nearby where you want it.
- Then the shuttle will drop the item next to your mouse cursor.
- If you have drones or resources in un-reachable spaces you can use this to move them :)

#### Shuttles:
	- Show Shuttle Controls: I've added controls to Shuttles/ShuttleHubs/Drones/RCs/Res depots, so you can pick and move them around, use this to hide the controls.
