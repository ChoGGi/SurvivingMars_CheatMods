This is needed for certain blacklisted functions in Da Vinci update and beyond.
Most people will not need to use this, modders may find it useful for testing.


You need to copy BinAssets to the SM program file folder (SteamApps\common\Surviving Mars)

To find the folder:
Open the Steam client.
Right-click Surviving Mars.
Go to Properties>Local Files>Browse Local Files.
Paste BinAssets into that folder.

(See Install Help.png)



Symlinking:
If you symlink the BinAssets folder, you won't need to update HelperMod manually.
Though HelperMod shouldn't be updated too often.
